                <h1>Introduction</h1>
                <p>Boring Tasks is a task manager to track and manage your routine todos.</p>
                <p>Did you also need to track when did you clean your dishwasher last time? Maybe last week or last month, who knows! Boring Tasks is now your friend to track it.</p>
                <p>>Boring Tasks allows you to track you routine tasks in an easy way. Just create a task with a period and set "done" whenever you done it. Or too lazy this time? Just skip it once. It'll automatically set it's due date by adding 1 period from now. And you'll have a prioritised list. Also you are able to see done/skip history of your task. Easy peasy!</p>
