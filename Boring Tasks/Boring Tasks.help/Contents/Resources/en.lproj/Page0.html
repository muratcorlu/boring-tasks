            <span class="Custom">Boring Tasks allows you to track you routine tasks in an easy way. Just create a task with a period and set "done" whenever you done it. Or too lazy this time? Just skip it once. It'll automatically set it's due date by adding 1 period from now. And you'll have a prioritised list. Also you are able to see done/skip history of your task. Easy peasy!</span>
